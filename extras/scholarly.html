            <h2>Stages of project development and our progress</h2>
            <h3>Thinking of the functionalities and feature needed.</h3>
            <p>
                We have started to think of the functionalities and features that we need to provide to the user and write them down.
            </p>
            <h3>Interface of the application</h3>
            <p>
                We have started to design the interface of the application for the needs of the user and to be able to implement the features.
            </p>
            <h3>Implementation of the features</h3>
            <p>
                1. We first implemented the login and register feature and data base table of users. <br>
                2. We implemented the feature to view the actual stock of the service and then to be able to be updated by the administrator, and created the database table for the items. <br>
                3. We implementd the feature to schedule and appointment for a service operation and the administrator to answer to the client's request for an appointment and the database table for the appointments. <br>
                4. We implement the feature to view the history of the appointments for each user. <br>
                5. We populate the tables and test the applications.
            </p>
            <h3>Version control system</h3>
            <p> For version controlling we used github. <br> We used github verry often for this project to always have a working application uploaded on github to go back to in case our local project has a problem, even if we pushed some really small updates. </p>
            <p> Me and my collegue tried to divide our work so we can work on different features of the app (preferably on different tables from the db) at the same time, however there were moments when some features required the attention of both of us so we helped each other. </p>
